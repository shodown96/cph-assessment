# Ticket Breakdown
We are a staffing company whose primary purpose is to book Agents at Shifts posted by Facilities on our platform. We're working on a new feature which will generate reports for our client Facilities containing info on how many hours each Agent worked in a given quarter by summing up every Shift they worked. Currently, this is how the process works:

- Data is saved in the database in the Facilities, Agents, and Shifts tables
- A function `getShiftsByFacility` is called with the Facility's id, returning all Shifts worked that quarter, including some metadata about the Agent assigned to each
- A function `generateReport` is then called with the list of Shifts. It converts them into a PDF which can be submitted by the Facility for compliance.

## You've been asked to work on a ticket. It reads:

**Currently, the id of each Agent on the reports we generate is their internal database id. We'd like to add the ability for Facilities to save their own custom ids for each Agent they work with and use that id when generating reports for them.**


Based on the information given, break this ticket down into 2-5 individual tickets to perform. Provide as much detail for each ticket as you can, including acceptance criteria, time/effort estimates, and implementation details. Feel free to make informed guesses about any unknown details - you can't guess "wrong".


You will be graded on the level of detail in each ticket, the clarity of the execution plan within and between tickets, and the intelligibility of your language. You don't need to be a native English speaker, but please proof-read your work.

## The data definition for the Custom Agent IDs
**Acceptance criteria:**
As a frontend developer, I should be recieve an extra `id_by_facility` that comes with every agent related API endpoint the application interacts with.

**Implementation:** 
- There should be an extra field called `id_by_facility` attached to the model of every Agent, this is the field that would be used to assign custom ID's by the facilities to every Agent that works for them.

- As the Agents are being serialized, the `id_by_facility` field should also be serialized. 
Moving unto their initial values, they should be left as empty or null initially and they would be added once a faility has hired the considered agent. So when Agents are being listed in any endpoint, the `id_by_facility` fields should either read null or the actual ids.

- When an Agent is being hired. The endpoint responsible for this should also be expecting `id_by_facility` so that it can be attached to the Agent as he or she is being hired. If at any point in time, they decide to terminate the contract with a particular Agent, they can simply remove the ID.


## How is each Custom Agent ID is generated
**Acceptance Criteria:** 
a facility should be able to view and change the custom IDs assigned to each Agent.

**Implelentation:**
- Assuming a UI already exists which shows a list of acceptable agents to be hired by the facility.
  
- When an Agent is to be hired, a modal or any other suitable view should be used to present a form that allows the facility to input the custom ID to be used by the Agent throughout the working period of the Agent.
  
- A UI should be developed to view the current Agent data, the view should also have a form with editable fields especially the `id_by_facility` field which can then be used to edit the Custom ID assigned by the facility.
  
- A function should be developed to go through the current agents hired by the facility to be sure that no other Agent possesses the same ID.
This function should run everytime the facility (whoever handles the Agent's information in the hiring facility) stops typing when inputting a value for the custom ID (`id_by_facility`).

**Note:** 
The facility should have the ability to edit only the information relevant to them, specifically related to the facility. Additionally, the facility should be granted access to view only the necessary information.


## How the Custom Agent IDs should be rendered in the reports
**Acceptance requirements:**
When reports are being generated by the system. The facility should be able to see Agent's assigned custom ID.

**Implementation**
- In the `getShiftsByFacility` function, where shifts per quarter are being returned along with each indiviual shift's assigned Agent metadata, ensure the the `id_by_facility` is also included.
  
- Develop a UI which can be used by the `generateReport` function. This UI will serve as a template for the generated PDF, allowing the data required for the reports to be presented in a consistent and visually appealing manner.
  
- To enhance clarity for the facility, the `id_by_facility` should be displayed as "Agent's Facility ID" when rendering the report, making it easier for the facility to understand.
  
- To guarantee that the generated PDF maintains the visual design of the created UI, it is crucial to choose an appropriate package that enables manipulation of the data visualization aesthetics. This might entail conducting research to identify the most suitable package for this specific requirement.
