# Ticket Breakdown
We are a staffing company whose primary purpose is to book Agents at Shifts posted by Facilities on our platform. We're working on a new feature which will generate reports for our client Facilities containing info on how many hours each Agent worked in a given quarter by summing up every Shift they worked. Currently, this is how the process works:

- Data is saved in the database in the Facilities, Agents, and Shifts tables
- A function `getShiftsByFacility` is called with the Facility's id, returning all Shifts worked that quarter, including some metadata about the Agent assigned to each
- A function `generateReport` is then called with the list of Shifts. It converts them into a PDF which can be submitted by the Facility for compliance.

## You've been asked to work on a ticket. It reads:

**Currently, the id of each Agent on the reports we generate is their internal database id. We'd like to add the ability for Facilities to save their own custom ids for each Agent they work with and use that id when generating reports for them.**


Based on the information given, break this ticket down into 2-5 individual tickets to perform. Provide as much detail for each ticket as you can, including acceptance criteria, time/effort estimates, and implementation details. Feel free to make informed guesses about any unknown details - you can't guess "wrong".


You will be graded on the level of detail in each ticket, the clarity of the execution plan within and between tickets, and the intelligibility of your language. You don't need to be a native English speaker, but please proof-read your work.

## The data definition for the Custom Agent IDs
Acceptance criteria: as a frontend developer, I should be recieve an extra `id_by_facility` that comes with every agent related API endpoint the application interacts with.

Implementation: 
- There should be an extra field called `id_by_facility` attached to the model of every Agent, this is the field that would be used to assign custom ID's by the facilities to every Agent that works for them.

- As the Agents are being serialized, the `id_by_facility` field should also be serialized. 
Moving unto their initial values, they should be left as empty or null initially and they would be added once a faility has hired the considered agent. So when Agents are being listed in any endpoint, the `id_by_facility` fields should either read null or the actual ids.

- When an Agent is being hired. The endpoint responsible for this should also be expecting `id_by_facility` so that it can be attached to the Agent as he or she is being hired. If at any point in time, they decide to terminate the contract with a particular Agent, they can simply remove the ID.


## How is each Custom Agent ID is generated
**Acceptance Criteria:** 
a facility should be able to view and change the custom IDs assigned to each Agent.

**Implelentation:**
- An Agent Form should be developed to view the current Agent data  and editable fields especially the `id_by_facility` field.
- A function should be developed to go through the current aganets hired by the facility to be sure that no other Agent possesses the same ID.
This function should run everytime the user (whoever handles the Agent's information in the hiring facility).

**Note:** 
Only facility related information should be editable by the facility and only necessary information should the facility be able to view.


## How the Custom Agent IDs should be rendered in the reports
**Acceptance requirements:**
When reports are being generated by the system. The facility should be able to see Agent's assigned custom ID.

**Implementation**
- In the `getShiftsByFacility` function, where the Agent's metadata is being assessed, ensure the the `id_by_facility` is also included.
- Develop a UI which can be used by the `generateReport` function so that when a PDF is produced, it inherits the given UI as a template
- On the report, the `id_by_facility`  should be rendered as `Agent's Facitlity ID` for easy understanding by the facility.
- As regarding the template to be used, a suitable package should be used to ensure that the PDF presented inherits the developed UI.
